## Features

1. Get liveroom information from [hololive offical schedule website](https://schedule.hololive.tv/lives/all), contains live time ( date and time ), liver's name and liveroom link in just serval seconds;
2. Classify the liverooms into "Streaming now", "Upcoming" and "Stream over" (from hololive offical schedule website). The liverooms which are streaming will be at the top and have marks;
3. Auto detect the user's timezone and display the accurate time (not in default Tokyo time).

## How to use

1. [Install BitBar](https://getbitbar.com/) and run it once to set the plugins folder;
2. Download the script and copy it at the plugins folder;
3. Refresh the plugin in your status bar and enjoy it.

## For Windows Users

Because there is not a tool such like BitBar on Windows platform, Windows users cannot use this script like a menu in their taskbar. But you can also execute this script in your terminal if you have python3 and `bs4` and `requests` module installed. You can get the same output.

## Notice

1. Need Python3 or above ;
2. ~~Need `bs4` and `requests` packages, you can install them with `pip3 install bs4 requests` ;~~
3. ~~If your `python3` is not at `/usr/local/bin/python3` , you might need to change the python3 interpreter's path at the first line of the script;~~
4. You can rename the script as `hololive_schedule.{xxx}.py` to let BitBar run the script with a custom time interval. For example, `hololive_schedule.90s.py` means run the script every 90s;
5. ~~Because there are many URLs to get, the script might need a little long time to run. On my device and network environment (MacBook Air 2018 & **CANNOT** connect to YouTube directly), it will take about 90s to refresh once;~~
6. ~~You will need a proxy if you cann't get access to YouTube directly;~~
7. Beacuse there are only YouTube liveroom links on the hololive offical schedule website, no BiliBili links are provided;
8. You may need to do `chmod +x hololive_schedule.py` to make the script working normally.
